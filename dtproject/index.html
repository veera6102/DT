      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Personalized Study Tools was founded with a single vision: to create a student-centered learning environment that acknowledges that no two students learn the same way or at the same pace. We strive to move beyond the traditional, rigid textbook approach toward an interactive, adaptable platform that meets students where they are.</p>
      <p>Our dedicated team of educators, developers, and psychologists works together to develop resources that incorporate the latest in educational research, technology, and motivational strategies. Our goal is to provide tools that reduce frustration, boost confidence, and ultimately improve exam outcomes for students from all backgrounds.</p>
      <p>We believe that every student's potential is unique, and by tailoring the learning process, we can help unlock their full capabilities while supporting their mental well-being.</p>

    <section id="problem" class="section info-section">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>High school students preparing for competitive exams face intense challenges – academic pressure, massive syllabi, and emotional stress can easily lead to burnout. Students juggle schoolwork, coaching classes, and extracurricular activities with limited time for focused study.</p>
      <p>Traditional textbooks and notes, while foundational, often present content in a fixed format with little room for adjustments based on individual needs. This "one-size-fits-all" model can frustrate students who struggle with certain topics or need slower progression, while those who grasp concepts quickly may become bored or disengaged.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overwhelming content:</strong> The vast volume of material makes prioritizing difficult without guidance.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of engagement:</strong> Static materials do not encourage active learning or participation.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor feedback:</strong> Delayed or no immediate feedback makes it hard to correct misunderstandings.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional toll:</strong> The stress from exams can lead to anxiety, loss of motivation, and health issues.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Statistics highlight:</strong> Nearly 70% of students report feeling overwhelmed, and more than 50% struggle to maintain consistent motivation when using traditional study methods.</p>
